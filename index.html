                My name is Olga Serenchenko (soon to be Tanas...still have to change my name to my husbands). I was born in Russia but have lived in Arvada, Colorado most of my life. I received my BA in Geography, Environmental Sciences from the University of Colorado Denver with a minor in Sustainability and a GIS Certificate. Currently I work for The WhiteStar Corporation as a GIS Technician, compiling, editing, and providing nationwide land data. I am also in a partime Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver, studying to be a fullstack web developer.

                On my free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband and new husky puppy. I love going outdoors-camping, hiking, and swimming.
